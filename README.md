# SatisfactorySave

This will allow us to have the same file and keep a bit of a version history.

We can start each session by having the host (or sole player) create a branch for that session on their local machine and publish it. Then with the new branch active you can play, just make sure to save in the game when finished. If no other players or overlap is happening then you can comit the saved game when complete. If you expect that another player would like to play the save then you can pull the branch back into main so that the main branch has the most recent save.

If we do not expect any sort of overlap issues we could work comlpetely in main but that is a little risky since one player can commit over another's progress
